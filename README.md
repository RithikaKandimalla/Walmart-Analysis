# Walmart-Analysis

Our team has undertaken the project "Walmart Retail Data Analysis Using MariaDB" with the goal of leveraging the powerful capabilities of MariaDB to analyze and interpret extensive retail data from Walmart. This project focuses on understanding the distribution of store sizes across different store types ('A', 'B', 'C') and examining the impact of markdowns on sales during holiday and non-holiday periods. By processing and analyzing this data, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help optimize store sizes and markdown strategies, ultimately enhancing profitability.

Throughout this project, we utilized a variety of skills including database design, data manipulation, and SQL queries to perform CRUD operations. We constructed a robust transactional database, ensuring data integrity and consistency with primary and foreign key constraints. Our approach included creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram to visualize data relationships and executing various SQL operations to manage and query the data effectively. By employing these techniques, we achieved a comprehensive analysis of Walmart's retail data, providing valuable insights that can drive data-driven decision-making for improved operational efficiency and profitability.
